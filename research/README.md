# Research: Platform Investigation

This directory contains investigation templates for platforms that require API/capability research before monitoring solutions can be developed.

## Platforms Under Investigation

| Platform | Status | Priority | Estimated Effort |
|----------|--------|----------|------------------|
| [RelaiR](RelaiR_Investigation.md) | Not Started | MEDIUM | TBD |
| [ASK](ASK_Investigation.md) | Not Started | LOW | TBD |
| [AJII](AJII_Investigation.md) | Not Started | LOW | TBD |
| [NexLP/Brainspace](NexLP_Brainspace_Investigation.md) | Not Started | MEDIUM | TBD |

## Investigation Process

1. **Document Purpose** - What does the platform do? What workloads run on it?
2. **API Discovery** - Is there an API? What authentication does it use?
3. **Monitoring Capabilities** - Native alerts? Status endpoints? Audit logs?
4. **Integration Options** - Can existing scripts be adapted? SIEM support?
5. **Vendor Contact** - Support ticket or documentation request if needed
6. **Recommendation** - Build custom, use native, or defer?

## Completion Criteria

An investigation is complete when:
- [ ] Platform purpose and usage documented
- [ ] API availability confirmed or ruled out
- [ ] Authentication method documented
- [ ] Available endpoints cataloged
- [ ] Native monitoring options documented
- [ ] Recommendation made with justification
- [ ] Effort estimate provided (if custom development needed)
